# @spikerko/spices
This is a *fork* of **@socali/spices**, but with fixed features like:
Song Lyrics were being fetched, without the LoadLyrics function being ran, which meant my extension (SpicyBG) was fetching lyrics, even though it never needed them.

This is a fixed version with no lyrics or romanization stuff.

All credits go to **@surfbryce**.
